# FC-NN_NanoDesign

Compact planar photonic elements serving for efficient control over the polarization of light are of paramount importance in photonics. Here we propose a design of a chiral periodic metasurface based on asymmetric unit cells formed by plasmonic nanodisks and nanorods. Using the FDTD analysis, we show that the collective lattice resonance harnessed by the diffraction coupling of the plasmonic unit cells is the heart of the revealed resonant 38% circular dichroism effect. The chirality of considered structure is enhanced using the deep-learning-assisted optimization of the metasurface design as well.
