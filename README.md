# FC-NN_NanoDesign

Compact planar photonic elements serving for efficient control over the polarization of light are of paramount importance in photonics. Here, we propose a design of a chiral periodic metasurface based on plasmonic nanodisks and nanorods arranged asymmetrically in a unit cell. Using the finite-difference time-domain analysis, we show that the collective lattice resonance harnessed by the diffraction coupling of the plasmonic unit cells is the heart of the revealed resonant 38% circular dichroism effect. The circular dichroism enhancement of the considered structure is improved using the deep-learning-assisted optimization of the metasurface design.
