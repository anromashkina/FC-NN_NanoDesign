# FC-NN_NanoDesign

Compact planar photonic elements suitable for efficient control over the polarization of light are of high interest nowa-
days. Here we propose a design of a chiral metasurface based on asymmetric unit cells formed by plasmonic nanodisks
and nanoblocks. Using the FDTD analysis we show that the collective lattice resonance harnessed by the diffraction
coupling of the plasmonic unit cellâ€™s is the heart of the revealed resonant 37% circular dichroism effect. Chirality of
such a metasurface is analyzed as well by deep-learning-assisted optimization of the metasurfac
